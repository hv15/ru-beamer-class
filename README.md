Radboud Beamer Template Class
=============================

This repository provides a Beamer template which is based upon the Radboud University
[PowerPoint presentation template][rutemp].

This work was forked (and subsequently moved into its own repo) from https://github.com/mklinik/presentations.

### Clear Frame

In some cases, where for instances the content of a frame is to large, we can remove the global background, removing
the footer banner.

For this we have the `clearframe` environment.

Todo
